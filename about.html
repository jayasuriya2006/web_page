Hi, I’m Jayasuriya,from Trichy. I completed my schooling at Government School, C. Ayyampalayam and am currently pursuing B.Tech <br>in Computer Science and Engineering at Dhanalakshmi Srinivasan University.
<br>
I have a strong curiosity for technology and programming, which motivates me to explore new tools, languages, and frameworks. My current
 focus includes <em style="font-weight: bold;">Java, Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), Python, SQL, C, C++, HTML, and CSS</em>. I enjoy applying these skills in small 
 projects to solve real-world problems.
<br>
Beyond coding, I have a keen interest in problem-solving and logical thinking, which I practice through competitive programming and 
hands-on projects. I’m also a state-level judo player, an experience that has taught me discipline, perseverance, and strategic 
thinking—qualities I bring to every challenge I tackle.
<br>
I am constantly learning and pushing myself to grow as a software developer, aiming to build innovative solutions that can make a 
meaningful impact.
<br>
When I’m not coding, I enjoy exploring tech trends, experimenting with new ideas, and sharing knowledge with peers. I believe that 
continuous learning and curiosity are the keys to success in the fast-evolving world of technology.
<br>
My Vision:
To become a skilled software developer who contributes to meaningful projects, creates practical solutions, and stays ahead in the 
ever-changing tech landscape.
